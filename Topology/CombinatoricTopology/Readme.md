Just i neat simple application far much easier then implementing the proof of the 4 color theorem :)
<br>
However it covers the 4 color theorem as a special case of genus 0. But weridly genus 0 was the hardest case for the coloring problem all of the others
where found to have a trival formula as demonstrated above. It just so happens it holds for genus 0 = four color problem!!!
