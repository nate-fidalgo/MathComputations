The valid operators for the sample_funcs.txt are + , - , / , * , the usually basic arithmetic operations in addition ^ for exponential <br>
along with () for precedence <br>
Also x and y are the only valid characters for the equation ones for x-axis and ones to represent y-axis. <br>
The equations can be implicitly defined or explicit but only 2d algebraic curve. <br>

Because this was written in python if one was slightly a hacker one could also modify the generated file to achieve any 2d plane curve not just restricted to algebraic. If one is familiar with NumPY. However there will be 3d functions and more general plane curve graphing in seperate code. To come later
