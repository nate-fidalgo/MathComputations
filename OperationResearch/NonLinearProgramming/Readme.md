This shall be the subfolder relating to optimization theory / OR related to things that cannt be solved thru linear programming (or modeled linearly).
<br>
Somethings to come are
<pre>
<code>
conjugate gradiant method
method of steepest decent
newtons approximation using jacobians
local search
quadratic programming algorithms
integer programming (cut the plane methods , branch and bounds ...etc)
Kuhn Tucker theorem
approximation algorithms
cases when local optimals still imply global optimals (usually this is the case when we have convexity conditions but we dont have them in nonlinear programming :) )
nonconvex programming algorithms
lagrange multipliers and lagrange relaxation method
many many more algorithms
</code>

<br>
NonLinear programming its much more unsolved realm of mathematics then Linear programming so its a neat subject matter for you interested check back!
<br>
LP can be done in polynomial time using ellipsoidal methods
<br>
A special kind of ILP = integer linear programming can be solved very efficiently these are the matching,maxflow ,networking problems.
But going into completely IP is NP complete and some problems like traveling salesman are perfect examples of this.
<br>
Its kind of mind boggling that Integer programming is like at the bridge between some problems being very efficient in P and the other side being NP complete/hard.
