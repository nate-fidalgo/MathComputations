 Android is a cool opensource embedded operating system runs on many different ARM devices. Maybe someday you will be an electronic engineer programming firmware of a electronic device. Android , Raspberry PI and Audrino Studios all stuff you should familarize with if you think your going the electronic engineering route!

 Maybe your not to into the electronic engineering side of things thats fine to you find alot of use studying the computation math for mortgages and compound interest. Maybe some day you will be the next CPA certified accountant , Financial planner , Actuarialist or Economist. </b>
