Its sizzly as hell but i hope it easier with this podcast type thing to understand then reading a readme file.

Because readme files and documents get to be a pain in the butt in typing them up. ProofReading them gets boring and the wording confuses people so i figured i try a short cut with audio podcast.

I am trying to see by this if the podcast audio files are easier to comprehend then readme files interms of understanding how to uses the Differentiation.java program
