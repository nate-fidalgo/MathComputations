The Matrix_Operations.java needs a little more work in adding functionality for cool things but eventually its on its way.

Now support in Matrix_String.java for computing resultant and determinants. Resultants give rise to being able to compute Discriminants of a polynomials as well.
These are important quantities not usually talked about in most courses discriminats in the case of quadratic polynomials is just b^2-4ac. But knowing how to compute the discriminant generally for any polynomial is neat. Discriminants usually are computed by computing the resultant and the resultant from the determinant of the sylvestries matrix. So Determinants , Resultants and Discriminants are very closely linked however most courses only focus on Determinants of matrices
