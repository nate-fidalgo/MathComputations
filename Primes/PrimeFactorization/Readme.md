This is where different factorization algorithms for primes exist.
Note currently vary trival prime factorization algorithms have been uploaded later i plan to add quadratic sieve , general number sieve , eliptical curve factoring algo ,...etc
As well as possible improvements on some performance with current top prime factorization algorithms!
