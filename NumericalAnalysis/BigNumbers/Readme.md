This folder is for improving on the ability to compute transcendental/algebraic functions/most used functions like trig ,hyperbolic ,inverse trig, logs ,nth roots and most of the standard mathmatical function that java.lang.Math package provides. Yet java.lang.Math is restricted to floating/double point precision fpu. This folder makes all these functions computable over arbitrary precision so one can quickly compute function values out to millions of digits if he is so inclined.
<br>
For specialfunction and mathematical constants out to arbitrary precision see the special functions folder this folder mostly focuses on Standard math function used most often. (aka trig, inverse trig , hyperbolic , inverse hyperbolic , exp , log , ln , nth roots )
