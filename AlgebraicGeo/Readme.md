This is where most computational algebraic geometry will be placed. Most code will be for grobner base computation and quantities associated to polynomials in 
several variables. However the less talked about or well know Macaulay's resultant for resultants of several variable polynomials could be explained as well.
And not many people know the link between Macaulay's resultant and hyperdeterminants that Cayley introduced as a generalization to determinants of matrix to a hypermatrix which can be represented as n dimensional arrays on a computer.

The obvious standard computation stuff in this folder would be
<pre>
<code>
1) computations involving solving systems of polynomial equation in several variables (thur grobner base and elimination theory
2) computing ideal membership problems
3) computing when two ideals are the same
4) computing the varities of an ideal and ideals of varieties
5) computing degree and dimension of algebraic curves/surfaces 
...

You can think of algebraic geometry as a generalization of linear algebra but to systems of polynomial equations of several variables to some extent.

And it is pretty neat that mathematicians found grobner bases and an elimination theory similar to gaussian elimination that we use for linear system solving.
