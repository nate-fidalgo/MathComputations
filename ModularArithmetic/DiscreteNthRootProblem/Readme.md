This is where nth root algorithms for finite fields or more generally finite objects such as finite rings,groups,fields,...etc will go.


Cipolla, Pocklington's, Tonelliâ€“Shanks to name a few for computing x in the equation x^2 = a mod p.

Most algorithms known focused on the quadratic reciprocity problem aka what i call the discrete square root problem.

But i am here to eventually take it to the next level and do cubic , biquadratic , and more generally try and tackle the more general discrete nth roots problem.

Work in progress!

Very neat subject area that should be taught more when teaching modular arithmetic

At any extent it is known to be a hard problem but maybe slightly easier then integer factorization and discrete log problem.
