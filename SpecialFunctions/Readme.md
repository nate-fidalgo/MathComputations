This is the folder where special functions common to math , engineering, physics,...etc get stored.

Right now a cool BernoulliNumber is the main topic and a very important one that doesnt get talked about enough.
<br>
And mostly overlooked but its a huge importants in connecting integration and infinite summations.
Leave it to the Bernoulli family there a power house of mathematical creativity

<code>
BernoulliNumber.java uses BigRational.java

Build: 
javac BernoulliNumber.java
Run:
java BernoulliNumber

Should display the 20th bernoulli number... i will fix the speed and allow one to compute any bernoulli number
Optimization of it is coming bare with me. And the more important features will be the ability to export your database so
others can compute the next bernoulli numbers where you left off.

Its all about making computing pascals triangle /combinations quick and lookup databases for previous bernoulli numbers... though i hold off because i think 
Srinivasa Ramanujan identities allow for the most efficient implementation to date so i might go with that instead.
