For numerical computation of solutions to ordinary differential equation.
<br> Most likely for the case when the ODE is nonlinear however there are some case where you want to approximate
<br>
nth order linear ODE with nonconstant cofficients perhaps as well
<br> PDE computation are under PDE folder
