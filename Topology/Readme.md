This folder is going to be for anything related to topology subject areas.
<br>
So like
<pre>
<code>
1) algebraic topology (i.e fundmental group , homotopy theory , co/homological algebra , knot theory )
2) differential topology (i.e morse theory , classfication of manifolds stuff )
3) combinatoric topology 
4) topological groups
5) topological space calculation
6) topological invariants , properties , operations 
...etc

</code>

<br>
I will probably focus on knot algorithms as i find knot theory one of the most interesting pieces of topology
<br>
But knot are still in the queue of things to complete because there difficult to represent on a computer
<br>
visual to draw them is quite difficult from Dowker Notation or conway notation 
<br>
So still thinking on the best way to preceed visually.
