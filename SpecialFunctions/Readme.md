Right now a cool Bernoulli Numbers are the main topic and a very important one that doesnt get talked about enough.
<br>
And mostly overlooked but its a huge importants in connecting integration and infinite summations.
Leave it to the Bernoulli family there a power house of mathematical creativity

<pre>
<code>
BernoulliNumber.java uses BigRational.java

Build: 
javac BernoulliNumber.java
Run:
java BernoulliNumber

Should display the 20th bernoulli number... i will fix the speed and allow one to compute any bernoulli number
Optimization of it is coming bare with me. And the more important features will be the ability to export your database so
others can compute the next bernoulli numbers where you left off.

Its all about making computing pascals triangle /combinations quick and lookup databases for previous bernoulli numbers... though i hold off because i think 
Srinivasa Ramanujan identities allow for the most efficient implementation to date so i might go with that instead.

Not only does bernoulli numbers play a connection in infinite summation linking to integration but it also has a link to computing exact formulas
for finite sums of the form n^k. As well as the famous zeta function even values that we all know and love.

<br>
At any extent if your not into bernoulli numbers then you should be at least into the zeta function and being able to compute bernoulli numbers.
Gives you a way to compute the next even zeta function values as well :)
