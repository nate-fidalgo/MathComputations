This folder will be for computational differential geometry quantities such as tensor , differential forms , interior/exterior product calculations.
<pre>
<code>
1) tensor operations/calculations are easily represented by n dimensional arrays
2) differential forms , wedge product/grassmannian  ...
3) curvature and many more differential quantities /functions go here.
4) manifold quantities such as dimension ,degree, bundle , invariants ...etc

<br>
Generalization of curvature passed dimensions 3 is challenging and mostly not well defined as a one type of curvature thing.<br>
Usually generalizing curvature to any dimension requires selecting specific desired quanties from the regular 2d / 3d standard curvature definitions.
<br> 
Which could be thru connections /parrellel transport properties or other types of curvature properties means , gaussian , normal sections curvature,...etc
<br>
Computational functions for Generalize curvature to any dimension is a slipper slope but if lucky all pull off coding a few major types of curvature for any dimenison.
<br> 
Someday not very soon though.
<br>
Basically curvature can be defined in many different ways and based on many different properties so trying to code this is much more difficult then tensors or generalized cross products.
<br>
So bare with me its cool stuff.
