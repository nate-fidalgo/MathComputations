This is where most computational algebraic geometry will be placed. Most code will be for grobner base computation and quantities associated to polynomials in 
several variables. However the less talked about or well know Macaulay's resultant for resultants of several variable polynomials could be explained as well.
And not many people know the link between Macaulay's resultant and hyperdeterminants that Cayley introduced as a generalization to determinants of arrays higher
then 2d arrays.
