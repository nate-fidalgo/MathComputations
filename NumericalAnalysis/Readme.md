This folder will hold numerical analysis algorithms topics like scientific computing , root finding , numerical integration/differentiation algorithms, numerical differential/integral equation solvers,
Finite element methods for PDE and ODE, Solving nonlinear equation/systems of equations , interpolation/extrapolation , least squares , numerical linear algebra,
splines, multivariable interpolation/extrapolation , function approximations , computing large digits of pi /other famous constants.... list goes on.

Perhaps even code for ploting 2d and 3d functions/multivalued functions but that depends on if i want to give graphical plotting its own seperate main folder, instead of just a subfolder under numerical analysis topics
