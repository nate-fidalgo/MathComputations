This is the stub section for explaining , code on simplex method , hungerian method , transportation problem , assignment problem , scheduling/sequencing
, traveling sales man problem , superpermuntations , lagrange multiplier methods , bin packing , knapsack problem , dynamic programming/greedy algorithms ...etc
<br>
Most students in business or mangagment of supply chains , industrial engineering ...etc majors get exposed to this more then the typical math /science student
<br>
I am here to demystify OR and relate it to what you already know from your linear algebra , and calculus courses.
<br>
OR is very important addition to solving optimization problems in a different way then usually exposed to in a linear algebra , or multivariable calculus course.
<br>
Its a subject that is a cross between computer science and math but is more a focus for the MBA students or industrial engineering students then the typical scientist/math guys.
<br>
I know thats changing now and becoming more universal but much is not taught in standard math circulums yet 
<br>
check back later under construction
